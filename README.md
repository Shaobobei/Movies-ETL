# Movies-ETL
###Britta is preparing for a hackathon. 
We need to gather data from both Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. Amazing Prime and Britta needs to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. We need to refactor the code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

### Resource used:
• Data Source : wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv, ratings.csv

• Software program:  Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook and pgAdmin 4

### Results:
•Wrote an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files

•Extracted and Transformed the Wikipedia Data

•Extracted and Transformed the Kaggle data

•Created the Movie Database
